Problem diagnosis:




Proposed treatment:
  In the average parking garage, a customer is given a ticket when they enter and then have to find a stop and park. Once a customer is ready to take their car out of the garage, they then pay using the ticket they were given on entry. There are several issues with this style of parking garage:
      1.The customer does not know the full cost until leaving
      2.The customer must find a spot to park
      3.The garage and the customer may be unaware if the garage is full
      
  To make the best use of the parking garage's space and provide a more streamed lined experience for the users. We plan to create an automated system. This system will use a graphical user interface (GUI) that will show available parking spots able to be use or reserve. The reservations will be by the hour, and the cost will be calculated upfront. This way, the system can not only track the places in use but keep track of the spots that will be in use at a later time. Garages could also adjust pricing based on how desirable a particular stop it. 
  
  The goal is to make parking garages running our system more appealing to potential users. Since customers using our system will be able to plan and park with greater efficiency, making more money for the garage and better use of the space.  
  
  To minimize unfair or unwanted charges for garage customers alerts will be used. Our system will also alert the customer if the time for there rented space nearing completion. The customer can then increase the time rental time for there spot. Our system will also take into account customers who need special parking be that oversize car or accessible parking spaces.
  
  We will measure the effectiveness of our garage system by two metrics. How long it takes for the average customer to park and more importantly, the income of the garage. The goals of our system are to decrease parking time and increase revenue for the garage.
